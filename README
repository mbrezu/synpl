This is supposed to become a structured LISP editor.
If it is reasonably successful, I will try to add support for
other languages.

The code is licensed under GPLv2. The full text of the license is
found in the file COPYING.

I'm keeping a log of progress and information there.

Goals:

- make it as easy to use as org-mode for Emacs, but for programming
  languages (imagine being able to move statements/arguments/elements
  of a list just like headers/list items in org-mode);

- do incremental parsing in the form of 'parsing of increments';

- better error reporting for parsing errors, make simple refactorings
  possible even when the source is broken (use the fact we knew the
  structure of the file at the last successful parse).

Enough talk. :-)
