Text Flow principles:

Text changes have two sources:
1) the user
2) the parser

Changes from 1) will be propagated from the abstract editor to the parse tree, 
which will propagate them to the TWC instance.

Changes from 2) will be propagated by the parse tree to the TWC instance, which will propagate them
to the abstract editor.

So, there are two flows, respectively:

1) IAbstractEditor - ParseTree - TextWithChanges
2) ParseTree - TextWithChanges - IAbstractEditor

All code must follow these conventions. If there is a new source for text changes, a new flow (that
agrees with the existing ones) must be added to this list.

In case 1), if there is no parse tree, the code will flow directly to the text with changes.
